# add_door
A utility function to add doors to a floor layout image

## requirements
open cv 2, matplotlib, numpy

## how to use
See demo.py for the example of using this utility

## Yet to do
1. This utility currently relies on manual setting of door length and door width. We might develop smart auto setting of door length and width later.

2. This utility only adds door to rectangle-like shapes in the image. We might extend to round and curved shapes later.
